# Multi-Level-Inverters

Inverters are power electronic devices that regulate the flow of electrical power. An inverter converts the DC voltage to an AC voltage.

## Half Bridge Inverter:
It consists of two switches, voltage sources of voltage equal to Vdc/2. The switches are balanced with each other so that when one switch is activated, another switch is automatically deactivated.

## Full Bridge Inverter:
A full-bridge inverter circuit converts direct current to alternating current. The components required for conversion are two times more than that used in single phase Half bridge inverters. The output will be equal to the given input i.e Vdc.

## Multi Level Inverter:
The multi-level inverter (MLI) is an improved form of a two-stage inverter. In a multi-level inverter we do not process two-level voltage instead in order to create a smoother stepped output waveform, more than two voltage levels are combined together.The smoothness of the waveform is proportional to the voltage levels, as we increase the voltage level the waveform will be smoother but the circuit complexity will increase.
